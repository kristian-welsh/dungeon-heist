dungeon game ideas

I want to create a roguelike that is *actually* very like rogue, and not at all
rogue*lite*, while simultaneously doing something new and unique that will keep
me interested in development. It must be novel in some way to retain my interest
as a project. This will also help the game gain an audience if i ever want to
achieve any capitalism with it.

I'll call keeping the true spirit of roguelike as it being a rogue-clone.
I'll call the novelty to retain my interest "game novelty"

- ways to keep it a rogue-clone
  - text based in console window?
    - might limit marketability
  - strict movement on a grid
  - zero metagame progression or soft-reset mechanics
    - no upgrading a base, keeping your stats, finding old gear, etc
  - focus on aquisition of knowledge and player ability as means of progression
  - strength of a playthrough is determined by successfully keeping powerful items

- quirk for game novelty
  - unusual theme
    - non-violent
      - heist
      - flower gathering
      - villager searching for adventurer that didnt return
    - ultra hardcore violence
      - the doom of rogue-clones
    - dungeon ecology and politics
    - create item shop inside dungeon society
  - non-standard gameplay focus
    - focuses on society simulation, eg: dwarf fortress 
    - high-realism
    - highly simplified inventory and controls
      - becomes a focused tactical game
    - time travel mechanics
  - technology improvements
    - semi-turn based
      - turn based in combat, not otherwise
        - why?
    - networked multiplayer in a rogue-clone
    - distorted game-space
      - fluidity with grid structure
      - bending flatlander reality

example of mixing ideas together to create full game:
You live in a dungeon society in old ruins, populated with monsters and wizards.
You are a thief in posetion of a magic time travel amulet, working their way up to bigger
and bigger jobs. There is an ancient relic - the amulet of yvendor - on display
in two weeks time. prepare for the heist without gaining suspicion of the
vanguard princes.
